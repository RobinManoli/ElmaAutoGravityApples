# ElmaAutoGravityApples

Backup your level before trying anything.

Select a lev with gravity apples.

All apples will change their  food anim number,
so that they can display specific apples
for every gravity type.

Make sure to use an lgr for this level that has:
qfood1.pcs as norm apple (no gravity),
qfood2.pcx as gravity up,
qfood3.pcs as gravity down,
qfood4.pcx as gravity left,
qfood5.pcx as gravity right.
